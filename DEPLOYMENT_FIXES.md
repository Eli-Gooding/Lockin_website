# Vercel Deployment Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix deployment issues with Vercel.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dynamic Server Usage in API Routes

Next.js attempts to statically generate routes by default, but some routes require dynamic features like cookies, headers, etc. The following API routes were updated to use dynamic runtime:

- `/app/api/user/route.ts` - Uses cookies for authentication
- `/app/api/webhook/route.ts` - Uses headers for Stripe signature verification
- `/app/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts` - Needs to be dynamic for proper request handling
- `/app/api/download/route.ts` - Needs to be dynamic for proper request handling

For each of these files, we added:

```typescript
// Set dynamic runtime
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

### 2. Missing Suspense Boundaries for useSearchParams()

Next.js requires client components that use `useSearchParams()` to be wrapped in a Suspense boundary. The following pages were updated:

- `/app/auth/page.tsx`
- `/app/success/page.tsx`

For each of these files, we:
1. Created a separate component that uses `useSearchParams()`
2. Wrapped that component in a Suspense boundary in the main page component
3. Added a loading fallback component

Example structure:
```tsx
function PageContent() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  // Component logic using searchParams
}

function LoadingFallback() {
  // Loading UI
}

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<LoadingFallback />}>
      <PageContent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

## Additional Notes

- These changes ensure that the application works correctly in a production environment on Vercel.
- The dynamic runtime setting is necessary for API routes that use server-side features like cookies and headers.
- Suspense boundaries are required for client components that use certain hooks like `useSearchParams()` to ensure proper hydration.

## Testing

After making these changes, the application should deploy successfully to Vercel without the previous errors.
